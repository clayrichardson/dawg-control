# Narrative
We ran this experiment to figure out why we were getting weird results from the sensor. The humidity seemed to drop initially, but then rise as the temperature dropped below 0ÂºC

# Procedure

## Freezer
Start the `humidity.py` script and place the sensor in the freezer.
## Refrigerator
Start `humidity.py` script and wait for the sensor to read ambient, then place in refrigerator.
